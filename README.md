# Grocery Store
The goal is to build an US online grocery store application using a database backend to store information about products, availability of products in the stock, and customers of the store. The application supports two types of users. Customers of the store can search for products and look up information about products, setup an account and change their preferences and account details, order products, and make payments. Staff of the store can modify and create products, update the availability of products in the stock, query customer information, and process orders.
